I am writing to apply for the position of Junior Software Testing Engineer (992406) at Ocean Networks Canada. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering and have been passionately pursuing software development challenges through academic electives, co-op positions, and personal projects.

I have experience with full-stack web development using a variety of web development technologies such as HTML5/CSS3, Javascript, Angular2, Ruby on Rails, and MySQL. Through this experience I have gained familiarity with database design and service-oriented architecture. Additionally, I have extensive experience testing and debugging software as well as designing test cases and writing unit tests. I understand the extreme importance of designing software to identify potential problems and improve testability. 

My wide-ranging work experience has given me the ability to work effectively within a team setting while also being a motivated, proactive and self-starting independent worker. I value clear written and verbal communication to ensure projects are completed efficiently. I also have excellent problem-solving skills which allow me to deal with the unknown and unexpected. I am extremely resourceful with the willingness and work ethic to learn new technologies and skills in the ever-changing field of software development. 

I believe that my experience, drive and passion for learning and hard work would make me an excellent addition to your team as a Junior Software Testing Engineer. I look forward to following up to this application.
