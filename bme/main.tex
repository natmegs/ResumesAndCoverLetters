I am writing to apply for the position of Medical Device Technical Specialist at BSI America. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering with a specialization in mechatronics and I believe my academic and professional background make me an ideal candidate for this position.

I have experience with medical devices in a clinical setting while working with Island Health in Victoria, BC. Here I was involved in medical device contract renewals, medical device preventative maintenance, and device procurement and installation in hospital settings. In addition to my clinical experience, I have research experience at UVic's Biomedical Design and Systems Laboratory designing, prototyping, and testing a medical ultrasound phantom to mimic the ultrasonic properties of the hand and wrist. My academic career has also given me extensive technical experience through a wide variety of project work. I have worked in teams to develop biomedical devices such as microfluidic chips and human lung simulators. Through these projects I was exposed to Solidworks design, machining, and key aspects of the product development lifecycle. Additionally, project work with biomedical image processing, mechatronics, and neural networks have given me extensive experience in MatLab, C, sensor integration, and with microcontrollers.

My wide-ranging work and academic experiences have given me the ability to work effectively within a team setting while also being a motivated, proactive and self-starting independent worker. I value clear written and verbal communication to ensure projects are completed efficiently. I also have excellent problem-solving skills which allow me to deal with the unknown and unexpected. I am extremely resourceful with the willingness and work ethic to learn new technologies and skills in the ever-changing field of Biomedical Engineering. 

I believe that my experience, drive and passion for learning and hard work would make me an excellent addition to your team as a Medical Device Technical Specialist. I look forward to following up to this application.
